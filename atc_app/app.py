Based on the context and segmentation of each transmission, label it as either 'ATC' or 'Pilot'. At the very beginning of your

## Welcome to the **ATC Transcription Assistant**

### What is this tool for?

This tool transcribes **Air Traffic Control (ATC)** audio using OpenAIâ€™s **Whisper medium.en** model, fine-tuned for ATC communications. Developed as part of a research project, the fine-tuned **Whisper medium.en** model offers significant improvements in transcription accuracy for ATC audio.

---

### Performance

- **Fine-tuned Whisper medium.en WER**: 15.08%
- **Non fine-tuned Whisper medium.en WER**: 94.59%
- **Relative improvement**: 84.06%

While the fine-tuned model performs much better, **we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the transcriptions**. For more details on the fine-tuning process, see the [blog post](https://jacktol.net/posts/fine-tuning_whisper_on_atc_data), or check out the [project repository](https://github.com/jack-tol/fine-tuning-whisper-on-atc-data). Feel free to contact me at [contact@jacktol.net](mailto:contact@jacktol.net).

### How to Use

1. **Upload an ATC audio file**: Upload an audio file in **MP3** or **WAV** format containing ATC communications.
2. **View the transcription**: The tool will transcribe the audio and display the text on the screen.
3. **Transcribe another audio**: Click **New Chat** in the top-right to start a new transcription.
